## Questions

#### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The module 7 project was made to read the temperature of the room and then turn on or off the heater depending on the set temperature for the room. For the module 5 milestone I needed to blink the led with the SOS or OK message in morse.
#### What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did well when it comes to analyzing how the project worked by reading the documentation. I enjoy reading the documentation of technologies and if I hadnt I wouldnt have been able to do any of the milestones or project.
#### Where could you improve?
I would definitely like to improve when it comes to more complicated bit focused work I still struggle when it comes to using pointers and I know they are helpful and important specially when it comes to using C.
#### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Through this course I got to use the debugging part of the IDE which I usually dont use and I instead use the build and run button. I would like to use the debugging button more often since I found it to be extremely helpful during this course.
#### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Definitely my knowledge in C. I found C to be an absolute nightmare when it comes to programming but the better I become in C the easier any other language will be.
#### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried using as many commments as possible and also making functions that could be reused as not to waste space and add to the already convoluted code.
